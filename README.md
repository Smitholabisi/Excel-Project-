### Recommedation 

RECOMMENDATIONS
The WIXSIN Company Sales Dataset was Analysis and the Dashboard was created me (Olabisi Smith). After Analysis this Dataset above, I discovered some of the company sales
revenue were performing better in catergory like urban and in state like ontario and Alberta.
I Recommend that more sales strategy should be implemented in the regions, sectors and states not performing very well. The following sales strategies below should be considered: The company can target the low revenue states as well as sectors(Rural, mix and youth) in their Advertisment promotions go forward and also add new products or services that targets their audience.
Wixsin Company can also give discount on some of their products or services.
The Company can create a survey form for their customers to fill online or in-store, sometimes that won't take more than 5mins of their customers time.
They can also do buy one get one half price promotion sales.
They can also check and study the areas and category doing well by checking the month doing well, in term of weather, seasons and location of stores.
